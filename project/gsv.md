## Overview

In Global Soil Virome (GSV) Project, we developed the most comprehensive soil virome compilation to date with 80,750 partial viral genomes from 1,824 deeply sequenced soil metagenomes and analyzed of this dataset revealed distinct environmental impacts and regional variation.

## Dataset Download

The viral genome sequences of GSV project can be downloaded from iVirus in fasta format through [cyverse](https://data.cyverse.org/dav-anon/iplant/home/fudong0610/GSV/GSV_viralseqs_20210325.fasta). 

Other associated data supporting the findings are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.
