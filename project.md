### [Global soil virus](/project/gsv.md)

We explore the viromes in soil ecosystems in global scale. We focus on relationships between viruses and their prokaryotic hosts in soil to explore the dynamic variation of viral community structure and ascertain the complex interactions between viruses and prokaryotic hosts.

### [Global soil MAGs](/project/2021-09-05-mag.md)
<img src="/img/posts/01smag.jpg" width="300" align="middle"> 

We conducted the first large-scale excavation of soil microbial dark matter by reconstructing 40,039 metagenome-assembled genome bins (the SMAG catalog). We aim to construct the SMAG catalog to be of great value and interest to the broad readership, and will serve as a valuable genomic database to drive significant advances in understanding soil microbial biodiversity and exploiting novel genetic resources.
